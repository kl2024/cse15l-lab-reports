In this lab report, you will implement all Group Choice Options (1-3) from Lab 5. Complete them for yourself (if you havenâ€™t already), and take the relevant screenshots listed below. Create a post with a few sentences of description about all the options available. 
Create it in a new file called lab-report-3-week-6 so that it gets a new page on your site, and add a link to the page to the index of your site. You will submit it to Gradescope as usual as a few links.
Streamlining ssh Configuration
Show your .ssh/config file, and how you edited it (with VScode, another program, etc)
Show the ssh command logging you into your account using just the alias you chose.
Show an scp command copying a file to your account using just the alias you chose.
Setup Github Access from ieng6
Show where the public key you made is stored on Github and in your user account (screenshot).
Show where the private key you made is stored on your user account (but not its contents) as a screenshot.
Show running git commands to commit and push a change to Github while logged into your ieng6 account.
Show a link for the resulting commit.
Copy whole directories with scp -r
Show copying your whole markdown-parse directory to your ieng6 account.
Show logging into your ieng6 account after doing this and compiling and running the tests for your repository.
Show (like in the last step of the first lab) combining scp, ;, and ssh to copy the whole directory and run the tests in one line.
